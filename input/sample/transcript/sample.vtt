00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to today's lecture on data structures and algorithms.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.000
We'll begin by discussing linear algebra fundamentals, specifically matrices and vectors.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.500
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The determinant of a matrix is a scalar value that can be computed from its elements.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Moving on to calculus, let's discuss differentiation and the chain rule.

6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The derivative measures the rate of change of a function with respect to its variable.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In probability theory, we work with random variables and probability distributions.

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The expectation or expected value is the average outcome of a random variable.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
For algorithm analysis, we use Big-O notation to describe computational complexity.

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Dynamic programming is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down.
